### Introduction
Bots, like any other application, require use of expressions to evaluate outcome of a condition based on runtime information available in memory or to the dialog or the language generation system.

Common expression language was put together to address this core need as well as to rationalize and snap to a common expression language that will be used across Bot Framework SDK and other conversational AI components that need an expression language.
